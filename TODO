##TODO

- Tests - What is the preferred way? testthat?
- Write documentation
- Add examples
- Fill in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE
- Check the values of the parameters in the query are valid.
- Consider using explicit function parameters to mirror the API parameters
   e.g. unitOfMeasure = 'E', ...
  rather than using ...
- Change get_station_info() to update_station_info(), bundle station info with package (similar to valid_opts), but allow user to easily update
- Include function to return nearest station and distance from lat/lon (Matt has code to do this)
